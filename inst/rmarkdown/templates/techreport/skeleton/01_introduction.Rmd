Welcome to the techreport document in csasdown. Included in this example document are many useful bits of information on how to write a reproducible technical report document using csasdown, which is based on [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/). If you get stuck on anything, read the csasdown [README](https://github.com/pbs-assess/csasdown/blob/master/README.md) carefully and all the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/pbs-assess/csasdown/wiki). There are many tips and tricks located in those pages. With that, we dive right in.

Inserting a hyperlink in RMarkdown is easy, just look at the code for the paragraph above.

Include references in the `bib/refs.bib` file in the same format as the example that is already in the file. This is called BiBTeX format. Once you have added the reference, you can cite it using RMarkdown in the following ways:

1. In parentheses: `[@edwards2013]` - [@edwards2013]
2. Inline: `@edwards2013` - @edwards2013
3. Without author: `[-@edwards2013]` - [-@edwards2013]

Note that the year part of the citation is clickable and will take you directly to the reference in the References section.

Here is an example equation. Note that csasdown automatically numbers it on the right-hand side of the page. It does this consecutively throughout the document sections, but appendices are each numbered on their own, e.g. A.1, A.2,... B.1, B.2,..., etc.

\begin{equation}
  1 + 1
  \label{eq:test}
\end{equation}

A reference can be included anywhere in the text, to refer to a section or appendix. For the first appendix in this document, the code looks like this: `\@ref(app:first-appendix)`. Adding that code inline will create a clickable link in the output file: See Appendix \@ref(app:first-appendix).

The code inside the parentheses comes from the tag after the header for the section. For the appendix, the whole header line looks like:

`# THE FIRST APPENDIX {#app:first-appendix}`

Everything in the curly braces except for the hash sign is the tag you use to reference a section.
